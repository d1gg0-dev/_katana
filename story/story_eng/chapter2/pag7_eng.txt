As he walked through the narrow streets, his eyes caught a flyer pinned to one
of the walls. The image of his face was a cruel reminder of his current
predicament.

"Someone is hunting me..." Takeshi murmured, tearing the paper from the wall
with a rough gesture and crumpling it in his hands.

Knowing he needed to hide, Takeshi bought a straw hat from the first shop he
found, trying to disguise his appearance. The katana remained concealed beneath
his gi, but the sound of a nearby conversation drew his attention to a group
of samurais and rōnins at a street corner.

"We're looking for this man, dead or alive, for a substantial sum of ryōs,"
said a samurai, showing the flyer with a determined expression.

"This guy looks strong; it could be a chance to test my skills and still earn
a bag full of ryōs," replied a young rōnin with a cheeky smile, adjusting the
sword at his waist.

"I've heard he wiped out the Shira Gang... Those rōnins had been wanted for over
a decade. If you find him, report to the shogun. I don't think a kid like you
stands a chance against him," warned the samurai, his tone one of concern.

"The golden age of the samurai is over. Many rōnins are stronger than you, and
I'm one of them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a hunt to start," retorted
the young rōnin, with an arrogant confidence.

Takeshi quickly moved away, aware that the village was filled with bounty hunters
and samurais. With the growing threat, he decided to seek refuge in the nearby 
forest, where he could use his knowledge of the terrain to his advantage.

"It seems this katana has really caught Tokugawa Ieyasu's attention. He's willing
to pay a fortune to get it back..." Takeshi thought, entering the forest quietly,
the shadow of the trees providing a brief sense of relief.

As he walked through the forest, his mind was heavy with doubts and reflections.
Was it worth risking so much for revenge? His thoughts were abruptly interrupted
when two rōnins appeared in front of him, their silhouettes standing out against
the dense foliage.

"So, it's you! From what the master said, I thought you'd be more imposing..."
commented one of the rōnins with a disdainful smile.

"The master warned that he is dangerous. Don't underestimate him," cautioned the
other, with a serious expression.

"I don't intend to kill you. And your master must not know much about me to be
spreading rumors," said Takeshi, drawing his katana with a calculated movement.

"Oh, the master knows exactly what he's talking about. But let's finish this
quickly," said the smiling rōnin, drawing his katana with a swift motion.

Takeshi, with his katana in hand, prepared for the confrontation. The smiling
rōnin, identified as Ono Yamato, advanced with a series of rapid and ruthless
attacks. Takeshi dodged the strikes with sharp precision, his skill evident
with every movement.
