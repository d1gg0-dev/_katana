The ensuing clash was a spectacle of technique and strength. The blades
collided with a metallic clang, and each movement was a perfect blend
of speed and precision. The ground around the combatants quickly became
covered with broken leaves and branches, a silent witness to the battle.

Even weakened, Takeshi displayed an almost superhuman skill. His movements
were a dance of endurance and refined technique. Baiken, on the other hand,
was like a whirlwind of quick and furious attacks, his katana slicing 
through the air with controlled fury.

The strikes came in a frenetic rhythm. Takeshi, with surprising agility, 
managed to dodge a deadly attack and, with a deft move, sliced one of 
Baiken's ears, a clear warning of his intent. Baiken momentarily recoiled,
his face twisted in pain and surprise. Seizing the opening, Takeshi delivered
a deep cut to his opponent's back.

Baiken fell to his knees, breathing heavily. The arrogant expression was 
replaced by a look of resignation.

"Finish it," Baiken requested, his voice weakened. "There's nothing more I
can do."

Takeshi looked at the fallen young samurai with a mix of compassion and 
frustration.
