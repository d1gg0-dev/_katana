The battle between Takeshi and Tadaaki was a frenetic duel. Tadaaki attacked
with uncontrolled fury, and Takeshi defended with relentless precision. The
sound of clashing blades echoed through the forest, each strike conveying the
violence and desperation of the combatants.

Finally, Takeshi found an opening. With a decisive movement, he disarmed
Tadaaki and delivered a final blow. Tadaaki fell, looking at his wound with
an expression of supreme pain.

"May he have mercy on your soul," Tadaaki said, with one last gasp of pain
before falling beside his brother.

Takeshi stood still, the weight of the battle and the knowledge of causing
suffering similar to what he had endured present in every fiber of his being.
Remorse and sadness were palpable, and he realized that his quest for revenge
was consuming his values and humanity.

The sound of approaching torches brought Takeshi back to reality. He looked
back and saw the shogun's samurais approaching, their voices mingling with
the sound of the wind in the forest.

"That's where the noise was coming from!" shouted a voice among the torches.

With one last look at the Ono brothers and the scene of devastation, Takeshi
fled deeper into the forest, his heart heavy and his mind tumultuous.


+--1600, Lake Inawashiro--+


At dawn, Takeshi sat by the edge of Lake Inawashiro, casting his bait into
the tranquil waters. The reflection of the sunlight on the water seemed to 
bring a moment of peace that contrasted sharply with the turmoil of the
previous night. His thoughts were troubled by pain and regret, but he
continued fishing, trying to find some clarity.

After catching a few fish, he left them roasting over the fire and went
to gather more firewood. When he returned, he found one of the fish already
devoured. The nearby footprints were evidence that someone had been there
recently.

"Can't you share a fish anymore? Did you know it's pretty hard to fish with
just one arm?" said a gruff voice, laden with familiarity.

Takeshi turned and saw a man sitting on a rock, watching him with a gaze
that mixed irony and affection. It was Itō Ittōsai, his former master, who
had suddenly reappeared in his life.

Takeshi and Ittōsai stood face to face in the clearing illuminated only by
the dawn light filtering through the trees. The atmosphere was heavy with
the weight of unspoken words and shared pain. The smell of blood and the
sound of fish crackling on the fire were a grim reminder of the battle to
come.

"I can't believe it! How did you find me here?" exclaimed Takeshi, his eyes
wide with surprise and relief. "I really need your help. I've faced 
hardships and need a guide to get out of this mess."

"My young man, I know everything. You didn't listen to me and ended up
becoming an enemy of the shogun by stealing his main weapon. I didn't teach
you to steal but to follow the Bushidō code," replied Ittōsai, his gaze a
mix of disappointment and weariness.

"I didn't steal anything! But I admit I lost myself in revenge. I believe
that with this sword I can uncover what Uesugi Kagekatsu has to do with my
family's death," argued Takeshi, frustration evident in his voice.

"I heard you were causing significant trouble, disrupting the order of Japan.
I know how powerful you are, and the only person who could defeat you is me.
But with just one arm, I have no advantage. I'm asking you to surrender and
return the katana to the shogun," explained Ittōsai, with a look of resignation.

"I don't know what they say about me, but I just defeated a samurai in a fair
duel and took down a gang of bandits. I'm not causing trouble to innocents,
just following my path and facing those who come in my way," said Takeshi,
enraged, his voice thick with emotion.

"I sent two of my best apprentices to defeat you," Ittōsai exclaimed, his
voice filled with anger and frustration. "Honorable men who died trying to
establish the Ittō-ryu school. Enough of your arrogance!"

The master drew his katana with a swift motion, his gaze fixed on Takeshi,
who felt the weight of Ittōsai's words like a cutting blade.

"So it was you! That's why they knew I was in the forest..." shouted Takeshi,
fury and pain twisting his face. "You want to kill me to open your school and
enhance your name! They died because of you!"

Takeshi's accusation reverberated among the trees, a lament of injustice and
rage. Ittōsai, with a face marked by determination and regret, raised his katana.

"I trained you; now I will destroy you!" roared Ittōsai, his voice a stormy roar.
The battle began.
