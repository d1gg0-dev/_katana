Even with one arm, Ittōsai's skill was formidable. Every strike he made
was an expression of his impeccable training, a brutal contrast to his
physical limitation. Takeshi, with adrenaline coursing through his veins,
fought with an almost animalistic intensity. His movements were swift
but imbued with a desperate force.

Ittōsai's strikes were meticulously calculated, his katana slicing through
the air with a cutting sound. Takeshi dodged with difficulty, his vision
beginning to blur from the effort and the blood flowing from a wound on
his face.

The duel continued, a deadly dance between master and pupil. The blades
clashed with a deafening clang, and sweat and blood mixed on the ground.
The surrounding environment was steeped in palpable tension, and the fight
seemed to stretch for hours, although time felt relative to both.

"I didn't want all this," Takeshi shouted, trying to find some shred of
reason in the chaos. "I lost my mind, and everything led me here. But I
need to know what happened in my childhood, why the feudal lord ordered 
my family to be killed..."

The sound of distant footsteps and voices cut through the charged atmosphere.
Ittōsai smiled bitterly, a dry laugh escaping his lips as he struggled to
maintain his strength.

"They found you. They discovered the bodies of the Ono brothers and knew
you would come through the forest..." Ittōsai said, his voice laden with dark
humor. "I came after you for the money. I wanted to open my school and thought
it would be worth the sacrifice. I was wrong. Now I see I won't get the reward.
Go and live your life. Remember, revenge will not bring your family back."

Takeshi's heart was heavy with a new layer of guilt and sadness. He hesitated,
the desire to stay and fight alongside Ittōsai battling against the urge to
move on.

"I'll stay with you; we can fight together..." Takeshi began, his voice
filled with desperation.

"We can't. We're too tired and wounded. Go, I'll buy you time. Good luck,
kid," Ittōsai said, accepting his fate with a sad dignity.

Ittōsai's declaration made the weight of the world seem to fall upon Takeshi's
shoulders. The battle had ended, but the pain and regret remained. With one last
look at the man who had been his mentor, Takeshi fled, his mind troubled and his
heart heavy. The morning light began to filter through the trees, and the distant
sound of a battle indicated that time was running out. Takeshi, now with impaired
vision due to the wound, ran towards Yonezawa, an uncertain destination and a new
determination in mind.

As he ran through the forest, the sound of footsteps behind him grew clearer,
a cruel reminder that his journey was far from over. With one last glance back,
Takeshi reflected on the weight of the choices made and the pain inflicted,
promising himself that his struggle would not be in vain.

"It won't be in vain," he murmured to himself, his voice carrying a mix of
determination and sorrow.


+--1600, Yonezawa--+


After months of relentless journey, Takeshi finally approached the walls of
Yonezawa. The city was in sight, but the road to get there had been one of
pain and sacrifice. His body, marked by scars and a recent wound, revealed
the weight of battles and wear. The bandage covering his right eye, a result
of his fight with Itō Ittōsai, was a constant reminder of his challenges.

Takeshi's steps were heavy, and each movement felt like a Herculean effort.
As he walked, a sudden sound broke the silence of the forest. A stone flew
through the air and struck his katana with a metallic impact, echoing through
the clearing. Takeshi turned with unexpected agility, his dark gaze and 
instinctive combat stance ready.

In front of him stood the young samurai he had seen in Kōriyama, a smug smile
on his face. His name was Shishido Baiken, and he looked more confident than
ever.

"Nice reflexes! So it was you I was looking for..." Baiken remarked, his voice
carrying a challenging tone.

"So you caught up with me..." Takeshi replied, his voice hoarse and tired but
filled with unwavering determination.

"Wow, you look finished," Baiken observed with a tone of disdain. "I thought
I had finally found a worthy opponent. Don't worry, I'll give you a dignified
death."
"Don't be mistaken. I can still fight," Takeshi responded, his voice now firm
despite his exhaustion. "Let's finish this quickly."

Baiken prepared for the duel with a triumphant smile. He drew his katana with
a precision that revealed his rigorous training.

"You should be proud; you'll be killed by Shishido Baiken. My name will be
known throughout the world as the strongest samurai of all time," Baiken
declared, his eyes shining with ambition.

"You're just like him..." Takeshi remarked, the memory of his master Itō
Ittōsai adding extra weight to his mind.
