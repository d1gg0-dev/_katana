"Stop now, Yamato! He's beyond our ability," shouted Ono Tadaaki, the older
brother, trying to intervene.

But Yamato was determined to prove his worth and ignored the warning. The
battle between Takeshi and Yamato was intense and brutal. Yamato attacked
with ferocity, but Takeshi stood firm, every movement calculated and deadly.
Finally, with a precise strike, Takeshi brought Yamato to the ground.

"Let me fight your brother and stay out of this, kid..." Takeshi requested,
pointing the katana at Tadaaki, who was clearly furious.

With a cry of rage and pain, Yamato charged at Takeshi, but it was Takeshi's
katana that found its mark. The young r≈çnin fell, spitting blood, and Takeshi
felt a pang of melancholy seeing Yamato's face twisted in pain.

Tadaaki, devastated by his brother's state, looked at Takeshi with eyes filled
with hatred and despair.

"No! You fool, I told you not to go..." lamented Tadaaki, his voice breaking
with pain and sorrow.
