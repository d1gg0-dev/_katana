The final battle was brief and brutal. Even weakened and with life
slipping away, Takeshi fought with the fury of a man with nothing
left to lose. Each strike he delivered was an expression of his
determination and pain, but he was at a disadvantage. The shogun's
samurais, well-trained and numerous, quickly dominated the situation.

In a few minutes, Takeshi was mortally wounded. He fell to the forest
floor, the same place where it all began and where it would now end.
His last thought was of his mother and brother. He closed his eyes,
accepting the darkness that enveloped him. The forest, a silent witness
to his life and death, welcomed him one last time.

Thus, the legend of Takeshi came to an end. His story of honor, revenge,
and tragedy would echo through the mountains of Yonezawa for generations,
a grim and powerful reminder of the cost of seeking justice and the pain
of a life marked by the desire for vengeance.
