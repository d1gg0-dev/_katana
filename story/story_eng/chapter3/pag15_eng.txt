The road leading to the Uesugi Temple seemed endless. Takeshi could barely
keep pace as he walked, but the sight of the temple, a symbol of power and
prestige, ignited a spark of hope and resolve in his heart. He had crossed
lands and faced countless challenges to get here, and he would not let
anything stop him now.

The temple guards, alert to the approach of a visitor, were taken aback
by Takeshi's condition. As he drew near, the expressions of surprise and
concern on the guards' faces were evident.

"I've come to see Daimyō Uesugi Kagekatsu..." Takeshi announced, his voice
hoarse and laden with a mix of exhaustion and urgency.

One of the guards, a burly man with a scar on his cheek, looked at Takeshi
with suspicion and curiosity.

"What happened to you? And what could you possibly have to say to Lord
Kagekatsu that justifies your deplorable state?" the guard asked, frowning.

"This..." Takeshi replied with difficulty, lifting his bloodied katana.

The metal glinted in the fading light, reflecting the shadows of the trees
and the temple.

The sight of the katana, with its unmistakable gleam and historical legacy,
made the guards exchange worried and respectful glances. Without further
words, they led Takeshi to the hall where Daimyō Kagekatsu was. Upon 
entering, Takeshi found Kagekatsu in conversation with a young man,
interrupting the dialogue as the unexpected visitor made his entrance.

Kagekatsu, an older man with an imposing presence and a serious expression,
looked up at Takeshi. The young man beside him, with sharp features and a
curious gaze, also turned to face the newcomer.

"Forgive me, sir, but this matter is urgent," one of the guards said,
interrupting the conversation and gesturing to Takeshi.

"What is it about?" Kagekatsu asked, his voice deep and authoritative.
"And why is this man in such conditions?"

Takeshi approached, his mind a whirlwind of emotions and thoughts, as
he drew the katana with a slow, almost reverent gesture.

"I came to find out what this katana has to do with you..." Takeshi said,
the tension in his voice evident.

Kagekatsu looked at the katana with a mix of surprise and unease. His
eyes widened as he recognized the weapon.

"Impossible..." he murmured, his tone changing dramatically. "The katana
of Uesugi Kenshin, the War God... Young man, how did you find it?"

"I found it in Edo, with a young man who had stolen it from the shogun's
possession," Takeshi explained, his voice growing increasingly frustrated.

"This is the Scarlet Katana. My father used it in several battles, and
there were stories about its power and curse. It was stolen by my father's
rival, Takeda Shingen, a long time ago. The Takeda clan must have given it
to the shogun to improve their standing," Kagekatsu said, his gaze filled 
with reminiscence.

The young man next to Kagekatsu, visibly surprised, leaned forward, his face
showing a mix of shock and understanding.

"Father, could it have been Sadakatsu?" he asked, his voice trembling.

"That stubborn boy!" Kagekatsu exclaimed, disappointment in his voice. "Seeing
his grandfather's katana, he couldn't help himself."

"Father, he went to the shogun to strengthen our alliance and ended up 
stealing the katana?" the young man continued, his voice full of disbelief.

"He must be hiding now. You know the trouble this has brought to our family,"
Kagekatsu said, disapproval evident in his tone.

"He's dead!" Takeshi declared, his voice cold and devoid of emotion.

The hall fell into a deep and oppressive silence. Kagekatsu sat down, the weight
of Takeshi's words falling on him like a heavy curtain of shadow. His son stared
at the floor, in shock.

"Thank you, young man, for completing my son's journey..." Kagekatsu finally
spoke, his voice filled with sadness. "Nagao, reward this man and tend to his
wounds. I will try to reach an agreement with the shogun..."

"No! I demand answers..." Takeshi interrupted, frustration and pain almost palpable
in his voice.

"About what?" Kagekatsu asked, rising from his chair with a concerned expression.

"What do you know about the murder of a couple and their child here in Yonezawa 
eighteen years ago?" Takeshi questioned, his voice filled with fierce determination.

Everyone in the hall watched attentively, their expressions ranging from
apprehension to curiosity. The tension in the room was palpable.

"How are you involved in this... I heard the assassins mention your name on
the day they killed my family," Takeshi revealed, his eyes fixed on Kagekatsu.

Kagekatsu became visibly agitated, his expression shifting to a mix of fear and
guilt.

"Forgive... Forgive me, young man. I... I don't know what you're talking about,"
the daimyō said, his voice trembling with anguish.

"It was you, wasn't it? You killed my parents and my brother... I've lived all
these years waiting for this moment," Takeshi said, his voice filled with pain
and rage. Without hesitation, he swiftly knocked out the two samurai who were
escorting him, the sound of their bodies hitting the floor echoing through the 
hall.

"You're insane! My father would never do something like this!" shouted Kagekatsu's
other son, drawing his katana with a look of fury.

"No... He's right..." Kagekatsu said, surprising everyone with his calm and dejected
voice. "I was very young when I became involved with a beautiful woman. Months later,
I learned that she had given birth to a child. I knew it was mine, but at that time, 
I ignored it. Years later, when I married Kikuhime, I knew that an illegitimate
firstborn could threaten my lineage, so I sent trusted soldiers to kill the woman
and her child."

"But... My brother couldn't have been your child..." Takeshi murmured, piecing together
the puzzle.

"So... You are..." the daimyō said, shock visible on his face as he realized his 
eldest son was now before him.

Takeshi was stunned for a few seconds. The revelations shifted his perception of the
situation, and his gaze, once filled with rage, now held renewed intensity. He moved
to attack Kagekatsu, but was interrupted by his brother, Uesugi Harunori.

"You will not do anything against my father and my family!" Harunori declared, his voice
firm and challenging.
