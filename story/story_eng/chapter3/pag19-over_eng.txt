The final fight was brief and violent. Takeshi, even weakened,
fought with the fury of a man with nothing to lose. But he was
at a disadvantage. The Uesugi samurai were greater in number.
Within a few minutes, Takeshi was mortally wounded. He fell to
the ground in the courtyard of the temple where he executed his
revenge, the place where it all began and where it all ended.
