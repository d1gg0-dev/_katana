Takeshi arrived in Yonezawa with the sense that the city, though familiar,
now seemed like a labyrinth of memories and trauma. The sun was setting,
casting a golden glow over the city walls, a cruel contrast to the
deplorable state Takeshi was in. His clothes were torn and bloodied, and
the look in his one visible eye was a mix of exhaustion and fierce
determination.
