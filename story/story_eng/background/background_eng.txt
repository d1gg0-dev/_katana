+--1575, Village of Yonezawa--+


The storm ravaging the village of Yonezawa was a spectacle of uncontrollable fury.
The sky, covered by heavy, pitch-black clouds, seemed to pulse with the energy of
lightning that sliced through the firmament. The raindrops fell heavy and relentless,
hammering the thatched roofs with an almost sacred violence. The wind howled with
a deafening wail, as if tormented spirits were making their final prayer.

Inside a modest wooden house, the chaos of the storm was overshadowed by the 
anguished cries of a woman in labor. Mayumi, the laboring woman, was in a state of
near-delirious exhaustion. Her hair was stuck to her face by a mixture of sweat and
tears, and her eyes shone with profound fear. The midwives, experienced and with 
calloused hands, worked with precision, offering words of encouragement and support.

The atmosphere was filled with palpable tension. The air was saturated with humidity
and heat, creating an oppressive sensation. Mayumi gave a final cry of effort, and 
the cry of a baby filled the space. The small, fragile sound contrasted with the 
storm outside, bringing a ray of hope and relief.

Mayumi, trembling with exhaustion, lifted the baby in her arms, examining the small
face that now depended on her. The tiny creature had rosy skin and eyes that blinked 
with innocent curiosity. Mayumi smiled through her tears and whispered with a tone
of reverence:

"Takeshi..." The name seemed to carry the weight of an ancient prophecy. She knew 
the future was uncertain and that her son's life would be marked by challenges.

Life in the village followed its course, with the routine of Mayumi and Akira molding
a semblance of normalcy. Akira, a robust hunter with a face marked by scars and a 
gentle gaze, brought not only security but a type of stability that seemed like an 
oasis amid uncertainties. The birth of Ishidoro brought a new sparkle to the family,
and Takeshi and Ishidoro grew up in an environment of affection and learning. Together,
the brothers accompanied Akira on excursions through the dense forests around Yonezawa.
The mornings were filled with the sound of birds and lessons on the arts of hunting and 
survival. 

Akira taught with patience, passing on his knowledge of tracking and strategy,
while Mayumi dedicated herself to selling pelts and meat, ensuring that the family did
not face hardship.

However, Takeshi, despite the seemingly tranquil routine, perceived something beneath
the surface. The look in his mother's eyes, sometimes lost and frightened when they
passed through the village, did not go unnoticed. It was as if a dark mystery loomed
over the family, a feeling that Takeshi, even so young, could not fully understand.

At seven years old, Takeshi had become a curious boy eager to learn. That night, the
moon was hidden behind heavy clouds, and the wind blew with an unsettling serenity.
Takeshi accompanied Akira on a hunt under the faint light of lanterns, absorbing each
lesson with a fervor that went beyond mere imitation.

As they returned to the village, Takeshi noticed something unsettling in the distance.
Two stealthy shadows were leaving their house, their shapes indistinct under the sparse
moonlight. Akira, with a grave and worried expression, told Takeshi to hide behind a 
stone wall. The fear in Akira's eyes was a warning that Takeshi could not ignore.

Hiding, Takeshi saw the men in intimidating armor, with an almost palpable aura of 
cruelty. One wielded a sword covered in blood, and the other seemed to command the 
operation with a gesture of disdain. Akira's scream, a sharp sound of pain and despair,
echoed through the night. Takeshi remained paralyzed, horror and helplessness freezing 
him in his hiding place.

When silence finally settled, Takeshi emerged to find his home in ruins. The scene was
one of total devastation: overturned furniture, torn clothes, and an inhuman chaos. The
bodies of his mother, brother, and Akira were scattered in the nearby forest, found by
Takeshi with deep sorrow. Among the trees, he heard one of the assassins mention the name 
"Uesugi" and "feudal lord" with a voice dripping with contempt.

Rage took hold of Takeshi, and he made a silent vow of revenge. The memory of his family
and the injustice they faced fused into an unyielding desire for justice.

Three years had passed, and Takeshi, now ten years old, had become a shadow of the
mountains. Solitude and relentless training had molded him into a young man hardened 
by life. The environment around him was filled with a sinister tranquility, his only
companions being the winds and the distant sounds of wildlife.

On an especially cold day, Takeshi heard screams and the clash of swords. His instincts
led him to a clearing where five men lay dead, the aftermath of a brutal battle. Among
the bodies, one man still breathed, his body covered in wounds and his countenance 
illuminated by a fierce fury. The man, with a severed arm and an enigmatic smile, 
raised a katana imposingly.

The man was Itō Ittōsai, a living legend in the world of samurai. His piercing gaze
met Takeshi's, and despite the gravity of his situation, he saw something in the boy—a
raw determination and a burning desire that intrigued him.

"You…" began Takeshi, his voice hoarse and resolute. "Who are these men?"

"Guerrillas, simple prey for a samurai like me," replied Itō Ittōsai, his voice carrying
an implicit respect. "And you? What brings you to these lonely mountains?"

"Revenge," said Takeshi without hesitation. "I want to become strong enough to face
those who destroyed my life."

Itō Ittōsai, seeing the intense gleam in Takeshi's eyes and recognizing the need
for a disciple, made a choice. With a slow and deliberate gesture, he offered Takeshi
the chance to become his student, teaching him the "Way of the Sword." Takeshi accepted
with a fervor that was almost palpable, the promise of training and power resonating in
every fiber of his being.
