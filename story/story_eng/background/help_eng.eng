INTRODUCTION TO THE KATANA GAMEBOOK

By Rodrigo Martins – Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ),
Computer Science course


+---About the Project---+


Katana is a digital gamebook developed as part of a university project
aimed at exploring and applying concepts of programming logic, data structures,
and flow control using the C programming language.

In addition, the project seeks to provide a hands-on introduction to the development
of text-based games and systems based on interactive numeric menus, simulating
an immersive and narrative experience in a terminal environment.


+---How to Play---+


The game is controlled exclusively by numbers typed on the keyboard. Whenever a
question appears on the screen, a set of numbered options will be listed.
Just type the number corresponding to your choice and press ENTER.

Example:

1 - Attack
2 - Defend
3 - Rest
4 - Use Elixir


GENERAL GAME STRUCTURE


+---Main Menu---+


When starting the game, you will see the main menu, where you can:

- Start a new game

- Load a saved game

- Enter training mode

- Adjust settings (language and text speed)

- View game credits

- Exit the game


+---Settings---+


You can choose between Portuguese (PT-BR) or English (EN), as well as
set the text speed (display speed for dialogue and menus). These settings
are saved for future playthroughs.


COMBAT SYSTEM


+---Turns---+


Each battle takes place in turns alternating between the player and the enemy.
During your turn, you can:

- Attack – Deals damage based on attack power, bonuses, and critical hit chance.

- Defend – Reduces damage taken on the next turn and grants a defense bonus.

- Rest – Recovers your stamina, which is essential for attacking or defending.

- Use Items – Ginseng, Elixirs, and others.

Stamina is consumed with each action and must be managed wisely,
as running out of it leaves you vulnerable.


+---Combat Elements---+


- HP: when it reaches zero, the character loses the battle.

- Stamina: energy used to perform actions.

- Critical: random chance to deal extra damage, increased proportionally
to the attack attribute.

- Dodge: some enemies can avoid attacks based on their stats.


SHOP SYSTEM


When visiting the town shop, you can spend your Ryōs (in-game currency) to purchase:


+---Consumables---+


- Ginseng: restores stamina.

- Elixir: heals HP.

- Sake: increases attack power for a limited time.


+---Equipment---+


- Armor: affects attributes such as HP, attack, and defense.

You can change armor through the inventory menu or by visiting the
shop. Each armor has unique characteristics that can enhance your
performance in battle.


INVENTORY SYSTEM


You can access your inventory via the player menu, where you can:

- View available items.

- Use items outside of battle (in some cases).

- Equip or swap armors.


PROGRESSION AND REWARDS


After a battle, you gain:

- Experience (XP): required to level up.

- Ryōs: used to buy items and equipment.


+---Leveling Up---+


When you accumulate enough XP, you level up and receive attribute points
to distribute among:

- HP – Maximum health.

- Attack – Damage dealt.

- Defense – Damage reduction.

- Stamina – Maximum stamina.

Distribute your points according to your combat style.


TOWN MENU


As you progress through the game, you'll reach the town, which serves as a central hub to:

- Continue the main story

- Buy items

- Access your inventory

- Perform training

- Allocate attributes


TRAINING MODE


Here you can:

- Fight against AI

- Play local PvP (2 players on the same PC)

- Watch automatic battles (AI vs AI)

It’s a great way to train without consequences for the story.


STORY


The game’s story is divided into chapters, which are unlocked as
the player progresses. The decisions made slightly affect the
difficulty of upcoming battles, offering an interactive and evolving
RPG experience.


TIPS FOR BEGINNERS


- Read each choice carefully before responding.

- Manage your stamina to avoid being left defenseless.

- Always keep healing items in your inventory.

- Use training mode to familiarize yourself with the controls.

- Distribute attributes in a balanced way, prioritizing attack or
defense based on your armor.

- Take breaks! The game automatically saves your progress with each
chapter.


FINAL CONSIDERATIONS


This project was designed for educational and learning purposes,
both for the player and the developer. The entire game code
was developed in C, with a focus on structure, organization,
and programming logic.

Good luck, warrior. May your blade be just and your mind sharp.
