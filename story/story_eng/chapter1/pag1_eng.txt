+--1600, Edo Capital--+


The capital Edo pulsed with frenetic vitality, its narrow and winding streets
intertwined with the incessant rhythm of merchants, samurai, and peasants. At
the epicenter of this urban whirlwind, a popular bar was enveloped in almost
palpable chaos. The sound of a relentless and escalating fight dominated the
environment. Then, with a crash, two men were thrown out of the bar, landing
heavily on the muddy street. They quickly got up, their katanas glinting under
the flickering lantern light, and their eyes shining with palpable fury.

From the bar's interior, an elderly man emerged, his posture upright and his
expression unperturbed. His laughter echoed over the silence that followed the
tumult.

“How can I make these scum stop challenging me?” said the man with disdain.
“You are an affront to the true spirit of the samurai. Ronin like you shouldn't
exist. I'll do the shogun a favor and eradicate these unworthy pests!”

One of the ronin, with a fierce look and a touch of contempt, retorted, “How
can we lose to a man without arm?”

From the bar, a young and firm voice cut through the air: “That one-handed
man is capable of defeating many stronger than you. Stop trying to make names
at the expense of true samurai and get back to work. Cowards like you don't 
deserve the title of ronin.”

The ronin looked at each other, their faces pale with fear. They sheathed their
katanas and fled hurriedly, leaving the place plunged into a dense silence.

The elderly man turned to the young man beside him, a smile of cynical
satisfaction on his face. “So, my boy, why did you stop them from challenging
me? Is your heart softening?”

The young man, weary and with a tone of exhaustion, replied, “We are leaving a
trail of blood wherever we go. We have traveled all over Japan, worked for 
feudal lords, and solidified your name. But killing these reckless challengers
is no longer our goal.”

The elderly man, with a contemplative look, continued, “Maybe it's time for my
journey to end. I no longer have the same vitality as before. I was thinking of
gathering our earnings and opening a school here in Edo…”

The young man looked intrigued. “So you want new apprentices?”

“I want to build an unshakable reputation. Opening a school in the capital would
make my name echo for generations. Everyone will know of my deeds, and my name
will be worthy of praise. Besides, I have already taught you everything I know.
You have mastered the Ittō-ryū style with excellence…”

The young man sighed, lost in thought while the old man continued, “So, how do
you plan to proceed now? Will you join me in this new venture?”

“Thank you immensely, master, for everything you have done for me. However, I
believe my path must be different from yours. I do not seek fame, but I have 
my own ambitions. I hope that the name of Itō Ittōsai gains even more notoriety,
and I will be proud to say that you were my master,” replied the young man with
firm determination.

“I had hoped to have you as my successor. It will be difficult to find another
young man lost in the forest like you. But, are you still thinking about your
revenge?” asked Itō Ittōsai, his expression laden with concern.

“No, sir. I will embark on a journey to improve myself in all aspects and 
seek my true destiny,” replied the young man with conviction.

“I hope to see you again someday and that you have found your destiny. But for
now, I will explore the forests of Japan to find another young man like you… 
Takeshi,” said Itō Ittōsai with an affectionate smile.

Both laughed and parted with palpable emotion. Takeshi knew that his path was
just beginning. His master's words reverberated in his mind, but revenge was 
still deeply rooted in his thoughts.

The streets of Edo continued to vibrate with energy. Merchants shouted their
wares, samurai patrolled with vigilant eyes, and children ran carefree. But 
Takeshi, oblivious to the frenzy around him, walked with the weight of past
memories and the desire for revenge heavy upon him. He followed the 'Way of
the Sword' not just for discipline but to find answers: who had killed his
family and why.

As he ventured through the streets, the commotion increased. The shogun's
samurai were searching establishments, causing uproar and fear among the 
citizens.

“What could they be looking for now?” Takeshi murmured, observing the 
confusion with a concerned expression. Determined to find refuge from the
agitation, he headed to the outskirts of the city, where the tranquility
of nature offered a brief respite from the urban chaos. There, he found a
large rock by a stream and sat, allowing himself a moment of reflection.
The names "Uesugi" and "feudal lord" echoed in his mind. Over time, he
discovered that the feudal lord of Yonezawa was Uesugi Kagekatsu, a 
respected and feared man. But was he responsible for his family's death?

While immersed in his thoughts, a weak voice interrupted his mourning.
“Yo... You must...”

Takeshi quickly turned and saw a young man gravely wounded, blood oozing
from deep wounds in his stomach and legs. The young man was trying to hide,
his katana visible.

“What happened to you?” Takeshi asked, hurrying to help.

“You must take...” the young man tried to respond before collapsing beside
the rock.

“So, you're a thief? You lost your life trying to steal a katana?” Takeshi
questioned, picking up the sword and examining it. “Are you the one the
samurai are looking for? You must have stolen it from someone very important
for the shogun to be after you.”

The young man, his breathing growing weaker, made a final effort to speak:

“Katana... Uesugi... Take...”

And with those words, the young man succumbed to his injuries. Takeshi was
perplexed and confused, the last words echoing in his mind. Uesugi, the same
name that interested him so much, the name linked to his dark past.

Takeshi held the katana firmly, his eyes shining with new determination. The
connection between the katana, the young man, and the Uesugi clan needed to
be unraveled. He knew his path was about to become even more dangerous, but
the quest for truth and vengeance had never been clearer.

“Uesugi...” he murmured to himself, standing up and sheathing the katana.
“Let's see where this leads.”
