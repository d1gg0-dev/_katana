The battle was a fierce and bloody dance. Takeshi, driven by determination and
fury, fought with almost supernatural precision. The scarlet katana cut through the
air with a sinister gleam, reflecting the moonlight with each movement. Shira,
with his experience and strength, proved to be a formidable opponent. Strikes
and counterstrikes echoed through the night, the swords meeting with the sound
of steel against steel, sparks flying with each clash.

Finally, Takeshi found an opening. With a swift and decisive strike, he disarmed
Shira. The gang leader fell to his knees, his gaze still defiant, but his life
force quickly waning.

“You are strong, boy... But this is not over yet.” said Shira, his voice a whisper
of contempt before succumbing to his wounds.

Takeshi, still panting and exhausted, barely had time to recover. The rest of the
bandit group advanced on him, using the trees and darkness as cover. A large,
imposing, and threatening bandit charged with brute force. Takeshi did not let
himself be intimidated. With an agile move, he slammed the giant against a tree
and pierced his abdomen with the katana.

“The power of this sword...” Takeshi thought, feeling the energy and strength
flowing through it.

With a new rain of arrows coming his way, Takeshi used the giant's body as a shield
and advanced towards an archer. With lethal precision, he severed the archer's arms
and grabbed the bow and quiver. Although his aim was not the best, he hit a shooter
before being surprised by the three rōnins from the inn, advancing at high speed.

In a sophisticated move, Takeshi cut the neck of a horse, making it fall on its
rider. But the arrow shots did not cease. Surrounded and cornered, Takeshi looked
at the blood-covered katana, which seemed to shine even more in his imagination.

“It's now or never.“ he murmured to himself, feeling a rising fury.

With a war cry, Takeshi entered a state of rage and faced the three rōnins alone.
His skills, sharpened by determination and the desire for revenge, transformed him
into a storm of steel and blood.
