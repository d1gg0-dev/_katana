Nagamoto, realizing the pressure and superior skill of Takeshi, attempted a desperate
attack. His katana cut through the air with brutal force, but Takeshi, guided by
instinctive precision, was faster. With a fluid and calculated movement, he disarmed
the samurai. The scarlet katana cut through the air with a deadly hum, and Nagamoto fell
to his knees, his weapon thrown far away.

“Please... have mercy...” pleaded Nagamoto, his face a mask of fear and desperation,
his eyes reflecting the light of nearby flames.

Takeshi, still panting and with his gaze fixed on the fallen samurai, felt his fury
slowly transform into a cold and determined stare. The anger he felt for Nagamoto and
the killers of his family was now crystallized in his determination.

“Mercy? Just like you had with my family?” said Takeshi, his voice laden with a dark
and relentless tone.

Nagamoto began to utter desperate words, but Takeshi was not interested in listening.
With a final motion, he silenced the samurai. The scarlet blade shone under the setting sun,
reflecting the intense glow of the moment.

With his heart still pounding, Takeshi cleaned the blade and sheathed it. He knew this
victory was just a small step in his long journey. With the sword now in his possession,
he felt he was one step closer to unraveling the mystery and achieving his revenge.

After a long journey, Takeshi arrived in the village of Utsunomiya, exhausted and
hungry. He found refuge in a small inn, where, despite his exhaustion, he managed
to fall asleep. However, the increasing noise coming from the lower floor woke him
in the middle of the night.

Silently, he descended the stairs and saw three rōnins, clearly looking for someone
with his characteristics. They were conversing in low voices, their expressions filled
with determination and a touch of fear.

“They're after me...” Takeshi thought, his heart racing with adrenaline.

Without wasting time, he returned to his room, grabbed his things, and jumped out the
window. The early morning was shrouded in darkness, a thick mist hovering over the village.
Tied next to the inn, a horse was waiting. Without hesitation, Takeshi stole the horse and
set off towards Yonezawa.

But fate was not kind. Suddenly, a rain of arrows shot from the surrounding bushes, piercing
the horse's thigh and making it whinny in agony. Takeshi fell to the ground, groaning in pain,
and crawled to a nearby tree for cover.

“Face me in a duel, you coward!” Takeshi shouted, his voice filled with fierce determination,
as he tried to ignore the pain that nearly paralyzed him.

“I came for that, young one.” a voice responded from the shadows, laden with calculated calm.
”Lower your weapons and leave him to me.”

Takeshi lifted his head and saw three archers in the mountains, their dark and imposing 
figures. Two men advanced towards him, their expressions revealing an interest far beyond
mere theft.

“You came for the sword.” said Takeshi, his eyes narrowed with a mix of anger and
determination.

“You're perceptive, boy. The shogun placed a great bounty on your head and an even greater
one for whoever brings back the katana you stole.” explained the man in front, his slim beard
and scars on his face betraying a life of combat and brutality.

“Face me in a fair fight. If I win, your friends will let me go.” Takeshi challenged, his voice
firm and resolute.

“You are not in a position to negotiate, boy. But facing the Shira gang alone would be cowardice.
I believe even the strongest of the shogun's samurai could not defeat us. But I, Hideyashi Shira,
will face you in a man-to-man duel.” declared Shira, an arrogant smile curving his lips.

Takeshi prepared himself, his body tense and his senses sharp. With the scarlet katana in hand, he
faced the leader of the Shira gang, the tension between them palpable like a rope about to snap.

“Let us begin.” murmured Shira, advancing with calculated agility.
